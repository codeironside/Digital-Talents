# Introduction

This API allows the user to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database of users. It has been built using Node.js and the Express.js framework. To handle large numbers of requests, the API uses the cluster module for creating multiple worker processes. Data validation and error handling is done using the express-validator middleware.
